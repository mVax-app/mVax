### User approval process

New users must be approved by an administrator before they can log into mVax and view/edit data. There are currently two different levels of account permission:

1. _admin_: admins can write new records AND see old records in the app. They have also have special privileges like approving users / editing special fields
2. _reader_: readers are able to still log-in to the app and view the data in the app but do not have permission to edit the records.

When it comes to new user registration, we only want people associated with Cl√≠nica Esperanza to be able to use the app. There is an approval process to limit who has access to this sensitive data. An _admin_ account is required to approve a user registration request before they have access to the app. The process is described below:

1. A prospective user downloads the app and requests to register for an account. The prospective user navigates taps the `Register` button and navigates to the following form.

![Register page](images/register_page.png)

Once this form is submitted, a user request is sent that can be approved by an _admin_.

2. A different user with _admin_ privileges approves the user. After logging in, an administrator goes to the settings page.

![Settings page](images/settings_page.png)

The _admin_ then clicks on the `Approve Users` button. This displays the list of current user requests. They click on the user request and choose whether or not to approve it.
