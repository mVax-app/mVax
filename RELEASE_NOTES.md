## Supported platforms

mVax is an Android application only supported by devices that run the Android operating system.

mVax is currently optimized for an 8-inch screen, specifically that of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2. The application supports both portrait and landscape mode. Running mVax on other Android devices may result in unintended consequences or cause unknown graphical errors.

**Minimum SDK**: Android 7.0 Nougat, Android API Level 24

**Target and Compile SDK**: Android 8.0 Oreo, Android API Level 26

mVax can run on any Android device running at least Android 7.0 Nougat with Android API Level 24 or greater. However, mVax has only been tested on the 8-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 running Android 7.0 Nougat with Android API level 24, since this is the device with which it will be deployed at Cl√≠nica Esperanza.
